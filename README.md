# ðŸ“Š Sales Analysis Summary

This project analyzes 9 years of retail sales data, totaling $1.20M across all outlets, with an average of $141 per item. Findings show a negative correlation between item visibility and sales, suggesting that more exposure doesnâ€™t always lead to better performanceâ€”possibly due to targeting issues or perceived quality. 

**Supermarket Type 1** had the highest revenue at $787,549. To boost performance, itâ€™s recommended that underperforming outlets offer discounts and receive more promotional support, while product visibility should be more targeted to the right audience.
